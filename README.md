This is a Network Packet Analyzer tool written in Python language that captures and display the "Source IP" , "Destination IP" , "Protocol" , "Packet Size". By default it will capture packets for 20 seconds. If you want to increase or decrease the timer, then you need to change the value of 'count' at last line(16) of the code.
